# {{ data.krate }}: ((Issue Title))

We (Rust group @sslab-gatech) are scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential memory safety and soundness bugs and found an issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to exhibit an undefined behavior.

We are reporting the issue directly to RustSec advisory-db because the issue tracker was not enabled on the upstream repository.
